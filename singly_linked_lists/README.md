# Singly Linked Lists – Basic Operations with Linked Data Structures in C

Welcome to this project focused on singly linked lists in C, a fundamental data structure that enables dynamic memory usage and flexible data management.  
This repository contains implementations for printing, counting, adding, and freeing nodes in a linked list.

---

## 📌 Learning Objectives

- Understand how singly linked lists work in C
- Learn how to define and use custom data structures with pointers
- Traverse, modify, and free memory dynamically in a linked list
- Use dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`
- Respect the Holberton project constraints and Betty style guidelines
