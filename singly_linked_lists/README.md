# C - Singly linked lists

## Description

The goal of this project is to understand and implement **singly linked lists** in C.

It focuses on:
- Creating and manipulating singly linked lists
- Handling dynamic memory with `malloc` and `free`
- Working with pointers and structures
- Following the Betty coding style and project constraints

## File Structure

| `lists.h`        | Header file containing the `list_t` struct and function prototypes |
| `0-print_list.c` | Prints all the elements of a `list_t` list |
| `1-list_len.c`   | Returns the number of elements in a `list_t` list |
| `2-add_node.c`   | Adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list |
| `3-add_node_end.c` | Adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list |
