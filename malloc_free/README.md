# Dynamic Memory Allocation in C

Welcome to this C project focused on mastering dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and proper memory management with `free`.  
This repository contains several functions that create, manipulate, and free dynamically allocated memory, including arrays, strings, and 2D grids.

## üìå Learning Objectives

- Understand how to allocate memory dynamically with `malloc`
- Duplicate and concatenate strings with allocated memory
- Create and initialize two-dimensional arrays (grids)
- Properly free allocated memory to avoid leaks
- Handle error cases when allocation fails
