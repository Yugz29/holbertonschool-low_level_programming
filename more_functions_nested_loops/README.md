# Advanced Looping and Conditionals in C

Welcome to this C project that builds upon basic loops and conditionals by introducing more complex functions and patterns.  
This repository contains a variety of small programs demonstrating character checks, number printing, and shape drawing using nested loops.

---

## üìå Learning Objectives

- Master nested loops for pattern printing
- Implement conditional logic for filtering output
- Understand ASCII character checks with helper functions
- Practice modular programming and header files
