# 🔁 functions_nested_loops – Fundamentals of Functions & Loops in C

Welcome to this C project focused on building basic functions, using nested loops, and reinforcing control structures.  
This repository includes multiple utility functions that cover character checks, printing patterns, arithmetic operations, and more.

---

## 📌 Learning Objectives

- Learn to declare and define simple C functions
- Use nested `while` and `for` loops
- Apply conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Understand ASCII values and arithmetic with characters
- Practice with `main.h` header, `_putchar`, and modular programming
