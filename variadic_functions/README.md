# Variadic Functions – Handling Variable Number of Arguments in C

Welcome to this project exploring variadic functions in C, which allow handling functions with a variable number of arguments.  
This repository contains implementations of functions that sum numbers, print strings or numbers, and handle diverse argument lists.

---

## 📌 Learning Objectives

- Understand how variadic functions work using `stdarg.h`
- Implement functions that accept a variable number of arguments
- Practice creating generic print and sum functions with different argument types
- Manage argument lists safely and efficiently
