# Mastering Recursive Functions in C

Welcome to this project dedicated to understanding and implementing recursion in C programming.  
This repository contains various functions that solve problems using recursive techniques, a powerful concept in computer science.

## üìå Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of recursion and base cases
- Implement recursive functions for string manipulation and mathematical computations
- Practice designing recursive solutions for factorial, power, square root, and prime number checks
- Deepen understanding of function calls and stack behavior
