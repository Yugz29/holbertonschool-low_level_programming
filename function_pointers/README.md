# üß© Function Pointers ‚Äì Dynamic Behavior in C

Welcome to this C project exploring **function pointers** and their powerful use cases!  
This repository showcases how to use function pointers for callbacks, iterators, and dynamic operator dispatching.

---

## üìå Learning Objectives

- Understand how to declare and use function pointers in C
- Pass functions as arguments to other functions
- Implement callbacks and iteration logic using pointers to functions
- Build a simple calculator using a struct of operators and function pointers
