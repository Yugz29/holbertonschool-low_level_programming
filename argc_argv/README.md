ðŸ§  argc_argv â€“ Understanding Command-Line Arguments in C

Welcome to this C project exploring the use of `argc` and `argv` in command-line programs! ðŸš€

This repository contains small programs written in C that demonstrate how to handle arguments passed to the `main` function. The tasks include printing arguments, counting them, and performing arithmetic operations using command-line inputs.
