# Pointers, Arrays & Strings ‚Äì Core Concepts in C

Welcome to this project focused on mastering pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.  
This repository covers essential operations like memory manipulation, string handling, array processing, and pointer usage.

## üìå Learning Objectives

- Understand and manipulate pointers to variables and arrays
- Work with strings: concatenation, comparison, search, and transformation
- Perform memory operations like `memset`, `memcpy`
- Handle multi-dimensional arrays and string arrays
- Implement common algorithms on strings and arrays
