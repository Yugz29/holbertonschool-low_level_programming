# Variables, If, Else, and While ‚Äì Basic Control Structures in C

Welcome to this project focused on fundamental C programming concepts including variables, conditional statements, and loops.  
This repository contains programs demonstrating the use of variables, `if`/`else` conditionals, and `while` loops to control program flow.

## üìå Learning Objectives

- Understand variable declaration and initialization
- Use conditional statements (`if`, `else`) for decision-making
- Implement loops (`while`) for repetitive tasks
- Combine these concepts to create simple but effective C programs
