# Structures & Typedef ‚Äì Working with Custom Data Types in C

Welcome to this project focused on defining and manipulating custom data structures using `struct` and `typedef` in C.  
This repository demonstrates how to create complex data types, initialize them, and manage memory dynamically.

---

## üìå Learning Objectives

- Understand and define `struct` types and use `typedef` for simplification
- Create and initialize custom data structures
- Implement functions to print and manage structures
- Dynamically allocate and free memory for structures
