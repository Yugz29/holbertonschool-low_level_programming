# 👋 Hello, World – First Steps in C Programming

Welcome to your very first C programming project!  
This repository contains basic exercises to get familiar with compiling C code, using standard I/O functions, and understanding how C programs are structured and executed.

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand the compilation process: preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking
- Use `gcc` to compile C files
- Learn the basic structure of a C program
- Print text using `puts`, `printf`, and `write`
- Get familiar with size and data types in C

## 📁 Project Files

| File Name         | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `0-preprocessor`  | Script that runs the C file through the preprocessor and saves the result in a file |
| `1-compiler`      | Script that compiles a C file but does not link |
| `2-assembler`     | Script that generates the assembly code of a C file |
| `3-name`          | Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun` |
| `4-puts.c`        | C program that prints a message using `puts()` |
| `5-printf.c`      | C program that prints a message using `printf()` |
| `6-size.c`        | C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on |
| `100-intel`       | Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file |
| `101-quote.c`     | C program that prints a message to `stderr` using `write()`, without using `printf` or `puts` |
