# üêö Holberton School - Low Level Programming Projects

Welcome to the collection of my Holberton School projects focused on low-level programming in C.  
This repository contains multiple projects covering essential C programming concepts, from basic I/O to advanced topics like pointers, recursion, and memory management.

## üöÄ How to Use

Each project folder contains a `README.md` describing the specific content, files, and compilation instructions.

You can compile individual files using:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 file.c -o output
