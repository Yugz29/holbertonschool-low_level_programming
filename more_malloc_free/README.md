# Advanced Dynamic Memory Management in C

Welcome to this project focused on advanced dynamic memory allocation techniques.  
This repository builds upon basic `malloc` and `free` knowledge by introducing safer allocation checks, string concatenation, zero-initialized memory, and array range creation.

---

## üìå Learning Objectives

- Implement safer memory allocation with error checking
- Concatenate strings with dynamically allocated memory
- Use `calloc` to allocate and zero-initialize memory blocks
- Create integer arrays within a specified range
- Manage memory efficiently and avoid leaks
